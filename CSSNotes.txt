1) Use a div to divide sections in your website and structure these divs separately. divs can be given a height.
2) Apply CSS box model properties to the divs. [margin[border[padding]]]
3) Common block elements (Take up the entire width of the parent):
	- paragraphs <p>
	- headers <h1> .. <h6>
	- divs <div>
	- lists <li> <ol> <ul>
	- forms <form>
4) Common inline elements (Take up only as much space as required)
	- span <span>
	- images <img>
	- anchors <a>

5) block elements can have their width changed. inline elements cannot have their width changed. block elements can be converted to inline elements and vice versa by changing the display property. use inline-block if we want to apply width property to inline elements.

6) HTML properties
	- Content is everything, block elements change their height based on the content.
	- Order comes from order in html file
	- Children sit on top of their parents. Use z-index to change z index of children. Dosen't work for static elements.

7) Position
	static - All HTML elements are static by default.
	relative - How an element will be positioned relative to how it would have been position. Use left, up, right, bottom to control position. Making one element relative and moving it 		   around will not affect position of other elements.
	absolute - Change element's position relative to its parent. Using the right property will push the element to the right of the parent div.
        fixed - give a fixed position to an element.

8) Centering elements:
	Either text-align center or margin : 0 auto;

9) Use absolute position to take an element out of html flow. Absolute inside relative to position elements inside divs.

10) font-size - 16px = 1em = 100%. Font Size gets inherited by child if its not a static size (px). 2em in parent and all its children would have font size multiplied by 2. Use rem to be safe.

11) Use float property to wrap a text around another element. Use clear property to not float (eg clear : left, clear : right).
